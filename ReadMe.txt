 Author: Moskvichev Andrey V.
 Version: 1.5
 Description:
 wxFreeChart is free powerful charting library based on wxWidgets. It 
 designed with flexibility in mind, and supports many types of charts 
 with many different configurations.
 Supported chart types are:
 - Line/histogram charts base on xy coordinates
 - Bar charts (vertical or horizontal)
 - Stacked bar charts
 - Layered bar charts
 - OHLC financial charts (bars or candlesticks)
 - Pie charts
 - Bubble charts
 - Gantt charts 

 Installation - win32
 --------------------

 When building on win32, you can use the makefiles in the BUILD folder using the
 WX_DIR, WX_DEBUG, WX_UNICODE and WX_SHARED to match your wxWidgets build.
 Examples:

   > nmake -fmakefile.vc WX_DIR=c:\path\to\my\wxWidgets WX_UNICODE=0/1 WX_DEBUG=0/1 WX_SHARED=0/1
   > make -fmakefile.bcc WX_DIR=c:\path\to\my\wxWidgets WX_UNICODE=0/1 WX_DEBUG=0/1 WX_SHARED=0/1



 Installation - unix
 -------------------

 When building on a Linux/GNU-based system, type

  ./configure
  make
  
 to build against the default build of wxWidgets (the one listed as 'default'
 by wx-config --list). Type "./configure --help" for more info.
